# Summation-Program:
This C++ program provides functionality to perform summations using different magnitudes. It utilizes object-oriented programming concepts to encapsulate the logic for performing summations, using Abstraction and provides a user-friendly interface for inputting parameters and displaying results.

## Follow Instructions:
1) Enter the start range of the summation.
2) Enter the range of the summation.
3) Choose the magnitude of the summation (i, 2i, or i^2).
4) View the result of the summation.
5) Optionally, increase the ending range of the summation by 1 and view the updated result.
6) Optionally, add a number to the summation of the ending range and view the updated result.
